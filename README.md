# HolzbaurLabWork
code written for my data in the Holzbaur lab

I'm a PhD candidate in Erika Holzbaur's lab at the University of Pennsylvania working on the regulation of molecular motors in neurons. I am new to coding, but am beginning to write MatLab scripts and FIJI macros to analyze my data. I am defintely open to suggestions for making my code more efficient. If anything I write is helpful/relevant to others, feel free to use.
